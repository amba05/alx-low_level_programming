Learn more about Malloc. Some thing i learnt

/**
* There is no need to type cast your malloc as malloc is already a void pointer
* which get pronoted to the initialized type. 
* Sizeof is not a function but rather an operator, so no need for the bracket when 
* cheking size of a variable. E.g sizeof boy
* NB: it is only used in checking size of Data types E.g Sizeof(int)
